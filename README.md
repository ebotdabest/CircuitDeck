**Simulate, Build, and Manage Virtualized PCs with Card-Based Computing**  

Welcome to **CircuitDeck**, a project where you can simulate virtualized computers and their memory, processing power, and applications—all represented as interactive cards. Build your own computational systems, manage resources, and experiment with app integration in a modular, card-based environment.

## **Features**  
- **Virtualized PCs as Cards**: Each PC is represented as a card, complete with customizable memory and processing power.  
- **App Integration**: Add small application cards to your PCs to simulate real-world usage.  
- **Resource Management**: Allocate and optimize resources like memory and CPU for each PC.  
- **Modular Design**: Easily add, remove, or reconfigure PCs and apps in a drag-and-drop interface.  
- **Simulation Mode**: Test and observe how your virtual systems perform under different workloads.

## **How It Works**  
1. **Create a PC Card**: Define memory, processing power, and other specs for your virtual PCs.  
2. **Add Apps**: Drag and drop application cards into your PCs to simulate usage.  
3. **Manage Resources**: Monitor and adjust resource allocation to optimize performance.
